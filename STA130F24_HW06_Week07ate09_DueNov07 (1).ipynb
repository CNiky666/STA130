    "The visualization demonstrates how the fitted regression line tries to approximate the true line, but it will typically deviate slightly due to the random noise in the data.\n",

    "However, with larger sample sizes or less noise, the fitted line tends to converge more closely to the true line.\n",
    "Takeaway\n",
    "This comparison illustrates the practical challenge in regression analysis: even when the true model is known, real-world data (affected by random errors) will lead to estimates that differ from the theoretical model. By understanding this, we can better appreciate the uncertainty in statistical estimates.\n",
