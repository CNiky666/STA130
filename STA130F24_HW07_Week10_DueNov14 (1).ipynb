    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "1. Code and write all your answers (for both the \"Pre-lecture\" and \"Post-lecture\" HW) in a python notebook (in code and markdown cells) \n",
    "    \n",
    "> It is *suggested but not mandatory* that you complete the \"Pre-lecture\" HW prior to the Monday LEC since (a) all HW is due at the same time; but, (b) completing some of the HW early will mean better readiness for LEC and less of a \"procrastentation cruch\" towards the end of the week...\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Paste summaries of your ChatBot sessions (including link(s) to chat log histories if you're using ChatGPT) within your notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Create summaries of your ChatBot sessions by using concluding prompts such as \"Please provide a summary of our exchanges here so I can submit them as a record of our interactions as part of a homework assignment\" or, \"Please provide me with the final working verson of the code that we created together\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Save your python jupyter notebook in your own account and \"repo\" on [github.com](github.com) and submit a link to that notebook though Quercus for assignment marking<br><br>\n",

    "### Prompt Engineering? \n",
    "    \n",
    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, \n",
    "2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.  Indeed, this is exactly the behavior [hardcoded into copilot](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/is-this-even-normal/0b6dcab3-7d6c-4373-8efe-d74158af3c00)...\n",

    "In this scenario, we have the following variables:\n",

    "Predictor Variables: TV advertising budget and online advertising budget. Both are continuous variables in the first part and are categorized as either \"high\" or \"low\" (binary variables) in the second part.\n",

    "Linear Form (without interaction):\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 TV_budget + β2 online_budget\n",
    "Explanation: This model assumes that the effect of each type of advertising is independent of the other. It estimates the direct impact of TV and online advertising budgets on sales separately.\n",

    "Linear Form (with interaction):\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 TV_budget + β2 online_budget + β3 (TV_budget * online_budget)\n",

It allows us to model the possibility that the effectiveness of spending in one channel depends on the spending in the other channel. For example, the impact of TV advertising might be greater when more is spent online and vice versa.\n",
    "Step 3: Making Predictions\n",
    "Without Interaction: The predicted outcome depends only on the separate effects of TV and online advertising budgets. For example, increasing the TV budget would lead to an increase in sales according to its own coefficient (β1), without considering how the online budget influences this relationship.\n",
    "With Interaction: When making predictions using the model with the interaction term, the effect of changing one budget depends on the level of the other budget. The presence of the interaction term (β3) implies that the impact of each type of advertisement is not independent, and it could be amplified or diminished based on the other advertising medium's budget.\n",

    "Linear Form (without interaction):\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 1(TV_high) + β2 1(online_high)\n",
    "Explanation: Here, the two advertising budgets are treated as binary variables (\"high\" or \"low\"). The coefficients β1 and β2 represent the effect on sales if the TV or online advertising budget is high, compared to a low budget, respectively.\n",

    "Linear Form (with interaction):\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 1(TV_high) + β2 1(online_high) + β3 (1(TV_high) * 1(online_high))\n",
    "Explanation: This model includes an interaction term between the two binary variables, indicating that the combined effect of high TV and high online advertising may be different from the sum of their individual effects. For example, having both high TV and high online might lead to an additional boost in sales that is not captured by the individual effects alone.\n",
    "Step 6: Making Predictions with Binary Variables\n",
    "Without Interaction: The prediction of sales is based on the additive effects of high or low TV and online advertising budgets. For example, if both TV and online budgets are high, the predicted outcome would be:\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 + β2\n",
    "With Interaction: When including the interaction, the prediction considers not just the individual effects of high advertising budgets but also the additional impact of having both high TV and online budgets:\n",
    "outcome = β0 + β1 + β2 + β3\n",
    "The interaction term (β3) represents the extra effect of having both high TV and high online budgets compared to just having them independently.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Model without Interaction: This is simpler and assumes that each predictor independently influences sales. It provides a linear, additive interpretation.\n",
    "Model with Interaction: This model captures the idea that the effect of one predictor may depend on the level of the other predictor. It provides a more nuanced understanding, especially when predictors may influence each other’s impact. The interaction term allows the model to account for relationships between predictors that could lead to more accurate predictions of sales when they work in tandem."

    "Coefficients represent the effect of each predictor variable on the outcome, assuming all other predictor variables are held constant. A larger coefficient indicates a stronger effect of that predictor on the outcome.\n",
    "P-values are used to test the significance of these coefficients. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis (which states that the coefficient is zero, meaning no effect). In this case, several coefficients are significant with strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, implying that those predictors have a significant relationship with the outcome.\n",

    "The low R-squared value suggests that there are factors affecting the outcome that are not captured by the model. The model only accounts for a small portion of the total variability in the data.\n",
    "Significant coefficients with strong evidence against the null hypothesis mean that some predictors still have statistically significant relationships with the outcome variable. This tells us that these predictors do have meaningful contributions, but they do not account for much of the overall variability.\n",
    "Example Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you're predicting house prices based on variables like the number of bedrooms and the size of the garden:\n",

    "If the R-squared is low, it means that many factors determining house prices are not included in the model (e.g., neighborhood, age of the house, market conditions).\n",

    "> _The **overfitting** observed in the previous problem is a question of **model complexity** relative to the amount of information or evidence available in a given dataset (or we could just say \"the amount of data in a dataset\"). The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _This question therefore addresses the topic of the **evidence** a given dataset provides for the **predictive associations** detected by a **fitted model**. It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "The design matrix essentially contains the numeric representations of these original variables and their interaction terms, used to make predictions for the outcome variable (model4_spec.endog).\n",
    "Multicollinearity in the Design Matrix\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high correlation between two or more predictors in the design matrix. This issue is prevalent in Model 4 due to the large number of interaction terms created, which tend to be highly correlated with each other or with the original variables.\n",
    "You can observe this multicollinearity by computing the correlation matrix of the predictors (np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)). High values in this matrix indicate that many predictors are linearly dependent on others.\n",
    "In the screenshot, we see that the condition number for Model 4 is extremely high (e.g., 12,000,000,000,000,000). The condition number is a measure of how sensitive the model is to changes in the input data. A very high condition number indicates severe multicollinearity, which causes:\n",
    "Unstable Coefficients: The coefficients of the model can vary drastically with even small changes in the input data, leading to less reliable estimates.\n",
    "Overfitting: With so many interrelated terms, the model can fit the training data almost perfectly, but it struggles to generalize to new, unseen data. This is because the model essentially \"memorizes\" the relationships in the training set, including the noise.\n",
    "Lack of \"Out of Sample\" Generalization\n",
    "The result of multicollinearity is that Model 4 has poor \"out of sample\" generalization. Specifically:\n",
    "In training data, the model might perform very well, leading to a high in-sample R-squared value, because it has learned all the intricacies and even noise of the training set.\n",
    "However, when applied to test data, it performs poorly, indicated by a low out-of-sample R-squared value. This is because the noise and redundant relationships captured by the complex interaction terms do not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "Centering and Scaling\n",
    "In the screenshot, we also see attempts to center and scale the predictor variables (using center() and scale() from patsy). This can sometimes reduce multicollinearity by making predictors more comparable in magnitude and reducing correlations between interaction terms.\n",
    "However, even after centering and scaling the predictors in Model 4 (model4_linear_form_CS), the condition number remained extremely high. This indicates that the initial complexity of the interaction terms was so great that centering and scaling could not sufficiently mitigate multicollinearity, and thus, the model still struggled to generalize to new data."

This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong.

In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations.

We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",

    "In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Performance: The in-sample R-squared provides insight into how well the model fits the data it was trained on, while the out-of-sample R-squared measures the model’s ability to predict new data.\n",
    "Generalizability Across Generations:\n",
    "If the out-of-sample R-squared for predicting other generations is much lower than the in-sample R-squared, it indicates that the model trained on a specific generation is not generalizing well to other generations.\n",
    "This highlights potential overfitting to the specific characteristics of one generation, reducing its ability to predict accurately for Pokémon from other generations.\n",
    "4. Key Takeaways\n",
    "Model Robustness: The results help assess whether the models (Model 7 and Model 6) are robust enough to be used across different subsets of the data. If a model trained on Generation 1 struggles to predict Generation 6, this suggests that the model is sensitive to generation-specific features.\n",
    "Model Bias: The differences in out-of-sample R-squared values reveal if there are biases in the models that make them less effective for Pokémon from other generations.\n",
    "Exploring Limitations: The illustration highlights that even though a model may perform well on one generation, it may not be transferable to others. This is especially important when building models that need to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration assesses how well different models generalize across Pokémon generations by training on one and testing on others. It helps evaluate model robustness, biases, and overfitting, highlighting how effectively the model captures broader patterns beyond a single generation."
